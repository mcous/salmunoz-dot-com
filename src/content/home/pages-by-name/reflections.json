    "<strong>Reflections on the Historic and Continued Erasure and Coopting of the Labor and Legacy of Trans Women of Color</strong> is a mixed media piece from 2015. Black and brown shoes were cut up and torn apart, and collaged onto a canvas and painted in a rainbow color scheme. This piece calls attention to how the mainstream gay rights movement has historically profited off of the work of trans women of color, while simultaneously ignoring their needs and rejecting them from the larger community. Trans Women of Color are the most impacted members of the LGBT community, who started the modern gay rights movement, and whose needs are consistently ignored for the benefit of mostly gay white men."
