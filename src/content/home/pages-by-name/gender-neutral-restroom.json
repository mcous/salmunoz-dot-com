    "<strong>Gender Neutral Restroom</strong> is a public installation from 2012. Posters are placed over menâ€™s restrooms on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, effectively declaring the space a gender-neutral restroom. This project is meant to call attention to the lack of gender-neutral restrooms on the UCSB campus, which is an issue that widely goes unnoticed in many public institutions. The project also humorously addresses the idea of gender-specific restrooms, while simultaneously discussing the lack of safety that many trans and gender non-conforming people feel in gender-specific restrooms. Unfortunately the posters were all removed (either by university officials or by students) within 24 hours of being put up."
