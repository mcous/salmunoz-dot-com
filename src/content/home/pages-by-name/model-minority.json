    "<strong>The Model Minority</strong> is an interactive installation from 2013. A large pile of fortune cookies sits against a wall on a table, which viewers are invited to take from and open. Inside of the fortune cookie, in place of a fortune, is a brief explanation of an aspect of the model minority. There are six different aspects of the model minority detailed in the cookies, and together they paint a picture of how problematic and damaging the model minority is. The fortune cookies represent a decidedly western interpretation and generalization of Asian culture, much like the myth of the model minority itself."
